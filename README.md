# Hansard web scraper

This very basic web scraper grabs the issues that are being discussed daily in the House of Lords and tweets them once a day. That's all it does for now. And running on a laptop on a loop.

Intend to host the script online somehow - if I can find something for free. Or write it in python and run it headless on a raspberry pi.

It uses [this library called Chatterbot](https://github.com/muffinista/chatterbot).
